### Transmission Routes of SARS-CoV-2 Genomes and VOCs in Bangladesh

We constructed 3 separate time-resolved phylogenies in order to understand the possible origin and transmission routes of early SARS-CoV-2 isolates as well as of B.1.1.7 and B.1.351 variants in Bangladesh.

## Phylogenetic Builds:
